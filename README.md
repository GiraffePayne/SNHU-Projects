# SNHU-Projects

-- Module Eight Journal --

The application is a small banking app  that has the basic workings of a way to view and edit your bank acount, with the primary use
being the interest calculator to determine how much interest you will receive.

From this class I would say I most definitely struggled learning some of the processes and implementing them into a real project. But I feel as though
my problem solving skills have gotten much better thank yo this class, and it is what I did the best during this class.

I need to work on my code efficiency. A lot of the time I will write code redundantly which losws down my program. Even though the
code works, it would benefit to make it fmore efficient and have more comments.

I struggled a lot with using multiple languages as it was very difficult to switch between the languages and syntaxes. But with
more practice I will get better at this.

This project helped me a lot with learning the process of developing a small project. I will use the skills I learned from this
project to develop more side projects more efficiently.

I first wrote the code and made sure that everything was working, then going back, adding comments, then rewriting some parts of the project
to make them more efficient and understandable.
